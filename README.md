# ElevateLabs_Task1
This repository contains the first task completed as part of my AI/ML internship under Elevate Labs. The project involved performing data preprocessing on the Titanic dataset, including data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. The goal of this task was to build a solid foundation in preparing real-world datasets for machine learning applications.
